### Task 1
Define an enum called "color" that represents color. In this enum, define three constants: RED, GREEN, and BLUE. In the main function, declare a variable of this enum type. In a switch statement, based on the value of this variable, print the color name to the console. 

### Task 2
Write a program that defines an array of random numbers, with the number of elements entered via the keyboard. Reverse the array (so that the elements are in the opposite order).

### Task 3
Define a structure called "person." In the structure, define the following elements: a name of type string and an age of type int. In the main function, declare a variable of this structure and assign values to its elements. Also, define a pointer to this variable and use that pointer to print the values of the structure's elements.
